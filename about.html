<h1>About Pharmacy hub<small>.......</small></h1>

<p class="lead"> To most a pharmacy is a place where you go pick up your mediation and the pharmacist hands it to you. Wrong! A pharmacy is the true guardian of health. Pharmacist play a detrimental in outcome of a person health. The main responsibilities of a pharmacist includes ensuring that the therapy that the doctor recommended is appropriate for the condition. Even if it is appropriate for the condition, the pharmacist must ensure that it’s right for the patient and at the same time checking for medication and any other lifestyle interaction. A very thorough investigation needs to be carried out on each prescription, sometimes it's in the best interest of the patient to call the doctor to suggest a better alternative, and sometimes the pharmacist has to cross check information. Due to the thoroughness it takes time. It takes time but all patients want to literally “ pop “ in and out of the pharmacy. The pharmacist must be able to maintain a balance that is processing the prescription at an efficient rate and at the same time being thorough in scrutinizing the therapy. For this to happen, there needs to be an efficient system.
This senior investigative aims to create a simple and effective system linking doctors to pharmacist across the country. Patients in Jamaica are still required to physically have a piece of paper carried from the doctor to the pharmacist. This system is described as an E-Prescription system, its aim is to cut accidents such as overdose/abuse, getting the wrong medication to patients thus reducing (complications) all on the doctors side. This system is very beneficial also to the consumer as  due to how it is organized in that it can suggest similar products based off contents and as fore mentioned will be a big boost to the patients making the processing easier making “poping in and out easy.”
